## Running Apps

Now that you've selected an app or topic, you can run it locally with ease:

1. Navigate to the specific app's directory:

   ```bash
   cd Part_1/directory_name/app-name

1. Start the app using:

npm start

If the app uses a different command for starting, replace npm start with the appropriate script mentioned in its README or documentation.

2. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the running app.
3. You can repeat these steps for other apps in different directories. Each app directory contains its unique code and resources.

Enjoy exploring, customizing, and experimenting with these apps to enhance your React skills!
