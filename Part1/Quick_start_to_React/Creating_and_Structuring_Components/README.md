# React Component Nesting Example

This repository provides a simple example of nesting components in a React application. Component nesting is a fundamental concept in React, allowing you to build complex user interfaces by composing smaller, reusable components together.

## Overview

In this example, we have created a parent component called `App` that represents the root component of our React application. The `App` component renders three child components: `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer`.

### Component Hierarchy

Here's a breakdown of the component hierarchy:

- `App` (Parent Component)
  - `Header` (Child Component)
  - `MainContent` (Child Component)
    - `Article` (Nested Child Component)
    - `Sidebar` (Nested Child Component)
  - `Footer` (Child Component)

This hierarchy allows us to organize and structure our UI into smaller, manageable components.

## Usage

To run this React application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/songurtechnology/frontend_development_with_react.git


1. Navigate to the project directory:

cd frontend_development_with_react/part1/quick_start_to_react/creating_and_structuring_components/casc

2. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

3. Start the development server:

npm start

4. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the running app.

Feel free to explore the code and component structure in this example to understand how components can be nested and composed in a React application.
